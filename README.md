# Course_3_Data_Engineering

The goal of this project was to create a data storage and processing pipeline to create an app to vizualise lightning data in California, an area of high wildfire risk. The data set was sourced from Google BigQuery public data, which was imported into SQLite database for storage. The data was brought into python and pandas was used to clean and process data into dataframes for Streamlit vizualisations, including a choropleth map and dynamic barchart of lightning strikes over time, and summary stats per zipcodes.

Please refer to the project writeup and presentation for full details.
